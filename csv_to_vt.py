'''
The script begins to fail by about the 140th value in the csv (Status code 429). Unsure if this is due to limitations of
the VT API key, or if its just general rate limiting.
EDIT: even with the buffer it starts to rate limit again at 240. Additional buffer required.

It seems like it's just rate limiting. I'm going to add a 2 second buffer after the 100th search.

It should be noted that on a personal license, we will be getting status code 429 after the 500th search.
